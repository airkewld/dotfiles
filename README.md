## dotfiles

### This repo contains my personal MacOS neovim workflow which includes the following:
- neovim config with some customizations of plugins and remaps
- macOS (homebrew) packages i use daily
- tmux config and script to open new based on selected directory
- .zshrc
- and more


This is all managed via ansible and you can install it on your machine by running ```./bootstrap.sh```

Once your machine is bootstrapped, do the following:
- Import the iterm2 profile
- run p10k configure to install the fonts
