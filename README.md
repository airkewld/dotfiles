## dotfiles

### This repo contains my personal MacOS neovim workflow which includes the following:
- neovim config with some customizations of plugins and remaps
- macOS (homebrew) packages i use daily
- tmux config
- .zshrc
- and more


This is all managed via ansible and you can install it on your machine by running ```make```

###  Once your machine is bootstrapped, do the following:
- Import the iterm2 profile
- run ```p10k configure``` to install the fonts
- enjoy :)
